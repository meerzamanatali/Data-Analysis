# Basic Data-Analysis
## Project Description
This project is a web-based data analysis dashboard built using Django, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The application allows users to upload CSV files, perform data analysis, and visualize the results interactively. Users can select numerical or categorical columns from the uploaded data to view statistical summaries and generate charts for better insights.

## Features
- File Upload: Users can upload CSV files for analysis.
- Dynamic Column Selection: Provides options to select numerical or categorical columns from the uploaded dataset.
- Statistical Analysis: Displays mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical columns and mode and unique values for categorical columns.
- Data Visualization: Generates histograms, boxplots, scatter plots for numerical data, and pie charts for categorical data.
- Interactive Dashboard: Allows users to switch between different analyses and visualizations seamlessly.
  
## Technologies Used
- Django: Backend framework for building the web application and handling file uploads.
- Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: Library for numerical operations.
- Matplotlib: Library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- Bootstrap: Framework for styling and responsive design.

## How It Works
1. Upload CSV File: Users can upload a CSV file via the web interface. The file is then processed and stored for analysis.
2. Select Columns: Users can select numerical or categorical columns for analysis through dropdown menus.
3. Numerical Columns: View mean, median, and standard deviation with corresponding charts (histogram, boxplot, scatter plot).
4. Categorical Columns: View mode and unique values with a pie chart.
5. Display Results: The statistical analysis and charts are displayed in
